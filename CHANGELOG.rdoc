= 2.0.0, release 2011-09-12

* Reverted code so that the <tt>2.x</tt> series supports rails <tt>2.3.x</tt> apps.
* Added a cucumber-based test suite.

The intent is that newer versions, specifically the <tt>3.x</tt> versions, will
support the <tt>3.x</tt> versions of rails while any rails <tt>2.3.x</tt> users
can always use the latest <tt>2.x</tt> version of this gem.
